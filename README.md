# General profile #

Hey! im Hkaar, a guy that does random projets and stuff with the pytho3n programming language.
I like to do make random projects that im interested in. I've been learning python3 for 7 months
now and still going!. 

Just to be honest here.. I don't know what to put in this README.md file or maybe im just too lazy. 
but soon i will add more to it and add more projects to my repositories so stay tuned hopefully..? 
I don't have anything more to say so that's it!.

Edit:
Sorry for my bad grammar and bad spelling of words!
